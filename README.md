# Easy Video Converter/Compressor

A tiny PHP-based script to convert and compress all **Video files** at current directly using **FFMPEG** tool. (God of video converters)

## Purpose

We held some science conference and what problem we was is to convert/compress all of conference videos, and it's was hard to handly do this.
So i write a script to did all these automaticly.

## Using

- `git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/EasyVideoConverter`
- `cd EasyVideoConverter`
- Put all of your video at EasyVideoConverter directory
- Finally, run `php EasyVideoConverter.php`
- After some times, you will see **MP4** files.

Many thanks from FFMPEG creator. (Fabrice Bellard)
